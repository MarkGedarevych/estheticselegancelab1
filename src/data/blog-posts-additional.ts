By removing damaged outer layers of skin, chemical peels reveal the smoother, healthier, more youthful skin beneath.</p><p>Unlike physical exfoliation methods, chemical peels work by breaking down the bonds between skin cells, causing controlled damage that triggers the skin&apos;s natural healing response. This stimulates collagen production, accelerates cell turnover, and reveals fresh, new skin.</p>"

As these bonds dissolve, the outermost layer of skin loosens and eventually peels away.</p><h3>Triggering the Healing Response</h3><p>When the peel creates controlled damage, your body responds with its natural healing mechanisms, including increased collagen production, accelerated cell turnover, and even melanin distribution.</p><h3>Depth of Penetration</h3><p>The depth depends on the type of acid, concentration, pH, and application time. Light peels work on the epidermis, medium peels penetrate to the upper dermis, and deep peels reach the lower dermis.</p>"

      question: "How long does it take to see results?",

      question: "How often should I get chemical peels?",

    {
      question: "Are chemical peels safe for dark skin?",
      answer: "Yes, but peel selection is crucial. Darker skin tones have a higher risk of hyperpigmentation with certain peels. We recommend gentler acids like lactic acid or mandelic acid."

      question: "Will my skin peel visibly after treatment?",
      answer: "Light peels typically cause minimal visible peeling. Medium peels cause more noticeable peeling, usually starting around day 3 and lasting until day 7."

      question: "How long does a lash lift last?",
      answer: "A lash lift typically lasts 6-8 weeks, which aligns with your natural lash growth cycle. Most clients schedule appointments every 6-8 weeks to maintain their lifted look."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I wear mascara with a lash lift?",
      answer: "Yes! You can still wear mascara if you want, though many clients find they no longer need it because their lifted, tinted lashes look great on their own."
    },
    {
      question: "Will a lash lift damage my natural lashes?",
      answer: "When performed correctly by a trained professional, lash lifts are safe for your natural lashes. The lifting solution is designed to restructure the lash temporarily without causing damage."
    },
    {
      question: "I have short lashes. Will a lash lift work for me?",
      answer: "Lash lifts work best for those with decent lash length who want to add curl. If your lashes are very short, a lift may not provide dramatic results. We will give you honest advice during consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I swim with a lash lift?",
      answer: "Yes! After the initial 24-48 hour setting period, you can swim, exercise, and sweat without affecting your lash lift. This is one of the biggest advantages over extensions."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a lash lift worth it?",
      answer: "Most of our clients find lash lifts absolutely worth it! For the convenience of waking up with perfectly curled lashes that last 6-8 weeks, the cost and time are minimal compared to daily curling or extensions."

A consistent, well-designed skincare routine is not just about looking good—it is about supporting your skin&apos;s health.</p><h3>Consistency Produces Results</h3><p>Skincare products work through consistent use over time. Your skin cells turn over approximately every 28 days, which means you will not see dramatic results overnight.</p><h3>Prevention is Easier Than Correction</h3><p>It is much easier and less expensive to prevent skin damage than to repair it.</p><h3>Professional Treatments Work Better</h3><p>If you invest in professional treatments like facials, chemical peels, or microneedling, a good at-home routine maximizes and maintains your results.</p>"

Enlarged pores, prone to blackheads and breakouts.</p><p><strong>Dry Skin:</strong> Feels tight, possibly flaky.

      question: "How many skincare products do I really need?",
      answer: "At minimum, you need three products: a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, and a sunscreen. From there, you can add targeted treatments based on your concerns. Quality over quantity."
    },
    {
      question: "What order should I apply my skincare products?",
      answer: "Apply products from thinnest to thickest consistency. A typical order is: cleanser, toner, serum(s), eye cream, moisturizer, then sunscreen in the morning."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from a new skincare routine?",
      answer: "Generally, give products 6-12 weeks before judging their effectiveness. Hydration improves quickly (1-2 weeks), while concerns like hyperpigmentation take 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I use the same routine morning and night?",
      answer: "Your morning and evening routines serve different purposes. Morning focuses on protection (antioxidants, sunscreen). Evening focuses on repair (retinol, chemical exfoliants, richer moisturizers)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use retinol and vitamin C together?",
      answer: "Yes, but ideally at different times. Use vitamin C in the morning for antioxidant protection and retinol at night. This optimizes their effectiveness and reduces potential irritation."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I really need to wear sunscreen every day?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! UV rays penetrate clouds and windows, so even on cloudy days you are exposed. Daily SPF is the single most effective anti-aging step you can take."
