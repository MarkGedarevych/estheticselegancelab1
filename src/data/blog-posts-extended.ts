      content: "<p>Hyperpigmentation is a common skin condition where patches of skin become darker than the surrounding areas. This darkening occurs when excess melanin—the pigment that gives skin its color—forms deposits in the skin. While hyperpigmentation is usually harmless, it can be cosmetically concerning and frustrating to treat.</p><p>Living in sunny Roseville and the Sacramento Valley makes hyperpigmentation a particularly common concern. Our abundant sunshine, while wonderful for outdoor activities, accelerates melanin production and can worsen existing dark spots.</p>"

They typically appear on areas that receive the most sun: face, hands, shoulders, and arms.</p><h3>Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)</h3><p>PIH occurs after skin inflammation or injury—most commonly from acne, but also from cuts, burns, eczema, or aggressive skincare treatments. The inflammation triggers excess melanin production.</p><h3>Melasma</h3><p>Sometimes called the mask of pregnancy, melasma causes larger patches of discoloration, typically on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. It is strongly influenced by hormones and worsened by sun exposure.</p>"

This is your skin&apos;s protective response—melanin absorbs UV rays to prevent DNA damage.</p><h3>Hormonal Changes</h3><p>Estrogen and progesterone can stimulate melanin production when skin is exposed to sun. This is why pregnancy, birth control pills, and hormone replacement therapy can trigger or worsen melasma.</p><h3>Inflammation</h3><p>Any skin trauma or inflammation can trigger increased melanin production in the affected area.</p><h3>Age</h3><p>As we age, melanin distribution becomes less even, and accumulated sun damage manifests as age spots.</p>"

Works well with most other ingredients.</p><h3>Alpha Arbutin</h3><p>A natural tyrosinase inhibitor derived from bearberry plant. Gentler than hydroquinone but effective for brightening.</p><h3>Kojic Acid</h3><p>Derived from fungi, kojic acid inhibits melanin production.

      question: "How long does it take to get rid of hyperpigmentation?",

      question: "Can hyperpigmentation be permanently removed?",

    {
      question: "Why is sunscreen so important for hyperpigmentation?",

      question: "Is it safe to treat hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones?",
      answer: "Yes, but treatment must be approached carefully. Darker skin tones have more active melanocytes and higher risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from aggressive treatments."
